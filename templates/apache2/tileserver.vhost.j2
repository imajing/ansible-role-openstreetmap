        # mod_tile can also serve arbitrary other tile types such as javascript vector tiles,
        # assuming the backend render daemon can handle the file type.
        # To this purpose AddTileMimeConfig takes a 3rd agument, the file extension and it
        # will guess the correct mimetype from it. If the mime type is not set correctly automatically,

        # mod_tile therefore offers the ability to automatically throttle requests from ip addresses that have
        # requested a lot of tiles.
        # The mechanism uses a token bucket approach to shape traffic. I.e. there is an initial pool of n tiles
        # per ip that can be requested arbitrarily fast. After that this pool gets filled up at a constant rate
        # The algorithm has two metrics. One based on overall tiles served to an ip address and a second one based on
        # the number of requests to renderd / tirex to render a new tile.

        #     However, as the X-Forwarded-For is written by the client this is open to manipulation and can be used to circumvent the throttling
        # 2 - use the last specified IP in the X-Forwarded-For list. If you know all requests come through a reverse proxy
